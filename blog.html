                <h3>HTML & CSS Basics</h3>
                <p class="content">Although I am only two days into The Iron Yard, I can say that it is intense. Luckily, I have a decent foundation
                    of HTML and CSS, so I am not struggling too much, but I definately feel for the cohorts who have not
                    touched code before. The program is intense and I now see why they produce such great results.
                </p>
                <p>Today, I got a better understanding of <i>ilnine</i>, <i>inline-block</i>, and <i>block</i> display properties.
                    I now understand the importance of semantics when it comes to markup. HTML are the bones of any webpage
                    and is vital that the markup is done properly and semantically. </p>
                <p>Although I am enjoying these first two days, I am ready to be challenged. I am 1000% ready to dive into JavaScript.
                    I know that I came into this program with the thought of focusing on Front-End, but now I think I may
                    want to specialize on Back-End.</p>
                <p>All in all, I am very excited and love the instrucors. Tanner effing rules!</p>

                <h3>CSS & Flexbox Intro</h3>
                <p class="content">So today, 5/24/2017, 3 days into The Iron Yard, was when it started to get challenging. I will probably look
                    back on this post a month from now and think "what a joke". But hey, it is what it is. Again, I do not
                    know how the other cohorts are able to comprehend this content without having never touched code before.
                </p>
                <p>I have been building websites for SMB's in my spare time for the better part of 7 months now. It has laid
                    a good foundation for CSS and I know how most properties work on a fundamental level. However, there
                    are several things that I have never dove into. Display properties are that thing. Today, our assignments
                    were basically to syle some markup to look like a screenshot of website we were given. These websited
                    were rather simple, but it was much harder than I anticipated. I could tell that the program and instructors
                    wanted us to use
                    <i>inline-block</i> alot. I'm assuming it is a property that is used a great in the web developement
                    world. Nonetheless, I do feel more comfortable with display after today. </p>
                <p>The homework for tonght was to get an introduciton into flexbox. Let me tell you, FLEXBOX IS GOING TO RULE!
                    Having only been exposed to the bottstrap grid system prior to The Iron Yard, it is a godsend. The fact
                    that flexbox is native to CSS is huge. There are no CDN's or ridiculous syntax calls, like the 372 classes
                    that you have to define in order to make a website responsive with bootstrap.</p>
                <p>I am very much looking forward to diving into flexbox for the remainder part of the week.</p>
                <p>Oh, and my cohorts are effing rad! :)</p>

                <h3>Flexin On 'Em With The Flexbox</h3>
                <p class="content">Today was definately my favorite day at The Iron Yard. We really got to utiilize flexbox and dive into positions
                    (i.e. relative and absolute). Let me say, after dealing with Bootstrap for the better part of 4 months
                    now, flexbox is the effing shit! It makes styling a site for responsive behavior a breeze. We built the
                    front of end two websites using flexbox. Hell, I even had a flexbox, in a flexbox, in a flexbox....That's
                    meta bro.
                </p>
                <p>Flexbox works by assigning a container element with the display value of 'flex'. This allows for all child
                    elements of said container element to become flex-items. These flex items can then easily be placed in
                    a row or column, in reverse order, and they can even be given spacing around them to make the child elements
                    apspear clean and professional. This is honestly just scratching the surface of what CSS's native grid
                    system, Flexbox, is capable of.</p>
                <p>I can say that I will ikely not be utilizing bootstrap any time soon, as I think I found my new grid system
                    GF. Let's hope we stay together for a while.</p>

                <h3>Forms, Git, & GitHub</h3>
                <p class="content">This past weekend was Memorial Day and I was out of town spending time with my lovely wife and parents. I
                    had an amazing time, but spent a great deal of time thinking about CSS and missing time posting on my
                    blog. Nonetheless, I came back to The Iron Yard on Tuesday with excitement.
                </p>
                <p>This Tuesday, we dove into forms. We started going over different types of inputs, form methods, form actions,
                    and styling forms with flexbox. It's pretty effing rad to gradually see everything we are learning become
                    full circle. Although our forms were only styled and had no actual function, it does let me see where
                    we this is all headed. Knowing when one should use radio buttons, checkboxes, text inputs, or textareas
                    seems trivial, but it is vital knowledge for visualizing how the users will interact with the UI. </p>
                <p>Today, Wednesday June 1st, 2017, we dove into git and Github. I heard three lectures from three different
                    instructors today and I finally feel like I have a solid grasp on git. I already knew that git was a
                    SCM or used for version control, but I didn't know exactly which git commands to use and when to use
                    (or not to use) them. I now the difference between forking and cloning a repo, using git init, git add,
                    git commit, git push, and how to set up and configure an SSH key. </p>
                <p>Git is conceptually simple, but can be technically confusing. The main take-away from I learned about git
                    is to constantly use 'git status', make commits early and often, and the importance of following cycle
                    of git and version control. </p>

                <h3>Week 2 Assignment, Using All Of It</h3>
                <p class="content">Every Friday, we are given a weekly assignment that encompasses everything we have studied for that week.
                    This weeks assignment was to build a completely responsive website using everything we have learned.
                </p>
                <p>Each Friday is dedicated to working on the weekly project as well as catching up on anyhing we might be behind
                    on. I was very excited to get this project started and honestly, I was excited to see how fast I could
                    build the front-end of a site and make it responsive.</p>
                <p>As I have mentioned earlier, I LOVE flexbox and all that it can do. I am starting to truly understand hoe
                    sites are architected and how nested an HTML document can become. I am about 75% done with the project
                    and did so in about a total of 6 hours of work. I am proud of that, as I had never touched flexbox one
                    week ago and now I am comfortable nesting flexboxes in flexboxes and div's inside div's. I feel confident
                    in what I have learned and feel like I am perputually understanding more and more concepts. </p>
                <p>We also had a (very brief) introduction to Javascript yesterday evening from 5:30pm till about 9:00pm. Although
                    it was mostly review for me, it is getting me JACKED to jump into using Javascript. As of now, I am still
                    looking into specializing in back-end technologies, but again, who the hell knows.</p>

                <h3>Wrapping Up Week 2 Assignment - Architecting & Flexing</h3>
                <p class="content">It's Sunday Evening and I just submitted my week 2 assignment. I am very proud of myself, as I finished about
                    75% of this project within 6-7 hours on Friday. I spent a couple more hours over the weekend styling
                    the last page, a calender, and tweaking the navigation spacing. One massive thing I learned personally
                    on this project was how effing rad viewport units (vw) are. Viewport units allow you to easily give a
                    div a defined shape and scale that shape perfectly regardless of the screen size.
                </p>
                <p>Also, have I mentioned that I am REALLY REALLY loving flexbox. I can't iterate enough how easy it makes responsive
                    websites. The biggest that I learned from the week 2 project was the importance of being mindful when
                    wrapping elements in div's. The architecture of your HTML really depicts how much effort will have to
                    go in on configuring the CSS to make it responsive.</p>
                <p>For me, I was looking at the mockups given to us for mobile, tablet, and desktop. Although we are designing
                    for mobile first, I looked at the tablet and desktop versions to see how I should be defining and wrapping
                    my containers. I have quickly learned that the more time you spend up front architecting you HTML with
                    purpose, the faster you can layout the page for all devices. </p>
                <p>If the pages' elemnts and sections are contained, wrapped, and named appropriately, you can pretty much achieve
                    any layout you want rather quickly with flex containers. </p>

                <h3>Getting Into Javascript</h3>
                <p class="content">Today was my favorite day at The Iron Yard thus far. We talked about functions and loops and went over coercion,
                    immutability, executional context, and scope.
                </p>
                <p>I loved the lecture around these topics. I learned that coercion is a big part of Javascript. It can be easily
                    seen by the use of '==' vs '==='. The '==' compares the value and ignores the type of the compared elements.
                    The '===' compares both the value and the type. Immutability is Javascript's ability to change the type
                    of a variable. Executional context has to do with anything within the scope of a function. Scope can
                    be either local or global. Scope is simply where variables have access. Are variables local to a specific
                    block or does it have free reign to be passed into anything.</p>
                <p>I am loving the problem solving aspect of programming thus far. Again, I am sure I am going to hate it in
                    the near future, but as of now, I LOVE THE CHALLENGE. I am using my brain in ways I have never done before.
                    Do I need to declare the variable globally, define it locally, use a for loop, nest a conditional statement
                    within said for loop? These questions get me so excited! One thing I am excited about that we have yet
                    to get to is DOM manipulation with JS. Although I have a feeling it is coming VERY SOON.</p>
                <p>I am way more interestd in the CS elements of programming than I thought I would be. I am fucking pumped
                    to see what our week assignment is this week. </p>

                <h3>Loops On Loops On Loops with Arrays</h3>
                <p class="content">Today was insanely exciting! We went over loops and arrays. When I say we went over loops and arrays, WE
                    ENT OVER LOOPS AND ARRAYS.
                </p>
                <p>The lecture this morning was a review of our homework on loops and arrays and how they actually work. i.e.
                    a for loop looks like 'for (let i = 0; i
                    < array.length; i++)
                        '. This is a way of iterating through eahch item in n array and oing something to each value. In regards to arrays, we went over how to create an array, how to add items to an array, how to remove an item from an array, and how to retrieve information from any given array.</p>
                    <p>Although the lectures were helpful, I always find the breakout sections even more helpful. I am definately a mechanical learner and need to physically tosee the code written, witness what it is actually doing, and then write the code myself. It is the only way I can conceptualize and retain anything.</p>
                    <p>The problem we were given for tonight was AWESOME!It was essentially a list of nine problems that we had to solve by writing algorithms. My cohort John and I went over the problems and activities together and the concepts we went over in the morning clicked big time. By the end of the day, I was able to write algorithms to loop through arrays, add every other element in the array, push the results to a new array, check the validation of a credit card, and locate the longest string in an array regardless of the number of items in said array.</p>
                    <p>I AM LOVING ME SOME FOR LOOPS</p>

                    <h3>Exploring Functions & Completing My First Functional Web App</h3>
                    <p class="content">The past week at The Iron Yard was challenging and insanely excited for me. We dove into functions heavily and began writing functions to solve problems. The beauty of functions is that they are re-usable code. When you are writing well defined functions, you are writing code that can probably be used outsise of the current project you are working on. Functions also make code more readable. It's way easier to read 'if (conditional statement == true) { doThing()}' rather than
                        'if (conditional statement == true { var x; for(let i = 0; i < array.length; i ++){x += array[i] + 1}}'. Simple put, functions kick ass. </p>
                        <p>This weeks assignment was to buid a calculator. I was responsible for making the front-end match
                            the mockup given to us as well as making it functional on the back-end. I approched this project
                            by first defining how I would handle the logic on the back-end. I wanted to get the back-end
                            logic done before moving on to the styling as I knew exactly how I was going to format the calculator.
                            I knew it would be a simple matter of using flexbox, borders, a number of divs, and specified
                            classes.
                        </p>
                        <p>The logic wasn't too dificult, but it was certainly challenging. This project required me to use
                            arrays, variables, loops, conditionals, DOM manipulation, and functions. If you think about a
                            calculator, it seems simple, but as with most things in programming, it was more difficult than
                            it seemed. In fact, if you think about how a calculator works, it's rather complex. Luckily,
                            Javascript has a built in function 'eval()' that takes a string like "54 + 4 -13", evaluates
                            it like it were intergers and symbols, and returns the result. However, 'eval()' does not respect
                            PEMDAS.
                        </p>
                        <p>I can definately feel myself gradually understanding concepts and recognizing what tools I need to
                            use to accomplish a taks before me. I actually has my first one-on-one with an instructor this
                            past Friday, and I was told I am doing 'very well'. In fact, I am ahead of the learning curve
                            and further along than the large majority of my co-horts. Of course this was great to hear, but
                            it just makes me hungrier to do even better. I am absolutely loving learning about OOP and basic
                            CS concepts. It's honestly made me consider one day getting my masters in CS, machine learning,
                            or the like....Actually, Let's see what I think about that in 2 months from now haha.</p>
                        <p>The web app I mentioned above can be found at <a href="https://github.com/keeganthomp/weekThreeProject/tree/master/SimpleVersion">this repo</a>.
                            I am effing pumped to see what this next week holds! Programming err day.</p>

                <h3>Algorithms & Things</h3>
                <p class="content">This week has honestly been difficult for me. We are finally getting into the grit that is programming, algorithms.
                    Although an algorithm is simply a set of steps, it is the heart of programming. Writing steps on how
                    to accomplish a task, but believe me, the most simple tasks can be complicated.
                </p>
                <p>As a class, we have been talking about how important it is to define a problem before jumping into solving
                    it. Today, we wrote an algorithm that would simulate a simple blackjack game. I worked with John and
                    Ian on this project and feel like I did reatively well. However, it was not easy. The biggest problem
                    that I seem to encounter with writing algorithms is with scoping. I understand scoping and how it works,
                    but when I am writing nested for loops and conditionals, I seem to get confused on where to declare variables
                    and where exactly to return them. This is something I will get better at with time. </p>
                <p>Prior to working on the blackjack project, we went over 'Big O Notation' and how best to approach writing
                    algorithms. Although I am still confused on what exactly 'Big O notation' is, I do know that it is used
                    to describe the comoplexity of an algorithm. As mentioned above, the best approach to solving a problem
                    is by first defining it.
                </p>
                <p>We had several problem sets given to us prior to the blackjack proejct and I loved somlving them. Although
                    it took me and my programming partner, Ian a while to solve the bubble sort problem, we eventually figured
                    it out by using a for loop nested in a while loop and a conditional within the for loop. Algorithms intrigue
                    me and something I will improve on as the weeks continue. I am being challenged rather intensely at this
                    point in The Iron Yard. I am hoping my problem solving continues to get better with time. My goal is
                    to be able to look at a problem and know exactly what tools to invoke to solve it. </p>
                <p>Remember when I said I wasn't being challenged.....</p>

                <h3>API's & Full Fledged Projects</h3>
                <p class="content">The later part of this week was awesome! We talked more about functions, fetching data, and using API's.
                    The concept that we can pull data from most sources with a token is baffling to me. It's pretty damn
                    cool in my opinion. We started out using the fetch API, which I believe is new to ES6, but Tanner, one
                    of our instructors at The Iron Yard, told us about this CDN, axios. Axios effing rules! axios > fetch
                    errday. You can GET data with axios in literally two lines of code. (i.e. axios get(url).then(function(response
                    {code here}));).
                </p>
                <p>The weekend project for this week was to build a web application that consists of a form, audio player, and
                    search results. It uses the Soundcloud API to retrieve tracks from any user typed into the search bar.
                    We were responsible for building this web app from the ground up. All the HTML, CSS, & Javascript. For
                    the HTML, I used HTML5 audio tags, which I had never used before, div's', headers, and p tags. For the
                    CSS, it has simply been a matter of flexing elements and centering containers. For the Javascript....it
                    was rather complex. I had constants declared, tokens to grab, data to parse, nested for loops, DOM manipulation,
                    and nested functions. This is a project I am VERY proud of. Looking over all the logic I completed, I
                    was rather baffled it all worked haha. I was able to obtain a user's input, search the API for said input,
                    display the tracks of artist entered in the input, allow any track the user clicks on to be played in
                    the audio player, and even updated a 'Now Playing' span to contain the artist and title of the current
                    song.
                </p>
                <p>Again, I always like to challenge myself to see how fast I can get a working version up and running. I was
                    able to get the the bones, format, and logic in place within about 12 hours. I was proud of this. I am
                    inching closer to understanding Javascript's syntax, conceptualizing how the code works, and better defining
                    the problems I have before me. The more defined the problem, the easier the coding will be.</p>
                <p>On another note, we did go on a 'field trip' on Thursday, 6/15/2017, to a company in Brentwood, TN. called
                    Change Healthcare. My fellow cohorts and I went to speak with a full fledged dev team and talk with them
                    about what being a developer is really like. It was cool to hear all the different aspects and team members
                    of a dev team. There were people from QA/QE, dev ops, front end, and back end. It was cool to hear that
                    even these badass devs hit problems every damn day. It put the vast knowledge of software developement
                    into perspective and allowed me to feel OK with not knowing even a fraction of it. Hell, you HAVE to
                    be OK with not knowing everything. The biggest take-away I took from the field trip was that deveopers
                    are first, problem solvers, and second, coders. Problem solving is everything in software developement.</p>

                <h3>Intro To Backend, Express.js, & Mustache</h3>
                <p class="content">This week started out with an intro to backend technologies. On Monday, June, 19, 2017, we got an overview
                    of the OSI model, how networks work, and what servers actually are. I learned that backend and servers
                    are synonomous. Whenever someone mentions the backend, they are refering to servers. I learned that that
                    applications use GET, POST, PUT, or DELETE to change, add, request, or alter data from the server. Something
                    else I found interesting is that an API is simply a server. I learned about methods like app.get, app.use,
                    and app.post. I learned about route's and the purpose and importance of both the request to the server
                    and response from the server.
                </p>
                <p>Today, we went over a templating node module called mustache that allows developers to pass in information
                    via variables, loop through arrays, and create conditional statements using a modified version of HTML.
                    To pass in a variable via Mustache, you would do {{variableName}}. To run a loop through an array you
                    would do {{#arrayName}} --some content-- {{/arrayName}}. To make a conditional, you would do the following
                    for true {{#someArrayOrObject}} ---some content-- and {{^someArrayOrObject}} for false. It looks confusing
                    and honestly, I am a little confused, but I know I will get it in time.
                </p>
                <p>Our project for the day was to spin up a server using Express.js and create a user directory for a list of
                    fictitional users that are robots. The array they gave us consisted of a about 30 objects who contained
                    key's that consisted of an ID, image, name, location, and job description. Our goal was to spin up a
                    server, use the Mustache model to loop through the information, pass in certain value's of particular
                    key's, and create an elegent, organized display of the users.</p>
                <p>John, a cohort who I have mentioned in prior posts, and I were working on adding an event listener to the
                    profiles that would allow you to click on any of the profiles, navigate you to route like '/users/:id'
                    where 'id' would be the ID of a particular robot and he page would dynamically change using Mustache
                    variables. The page would ultimately be passing in data from the array of objects that corresponded to
                    the ID given. Although we have not yet figured out how to accomplish this on 'click', we were able to
                    use request parameters to give us a page dedicated to the robot who's ID was passed into the URL (i.e.
                    'localhost:3000/users/3' would give a profile on a robot with an ID of 3). </p>

                <h3>Node, NPM, Routes, Client's Request, & Server Responses</h3>
                <p class="content">The past few days have been conceptually challenging for me. As I might have mentioned previously, I have
                    zero experience with the backend. I had an idea of waht node.js was, but didn't fully understand how
                    it worked or how powerful it can be. The thing that makes node.js so great is it's modules (or packages).
                    Node.js has more packages for it than any other backend technology. Lately, we have been using express,
                    mustache-express, body-parser, express-validator, and express-sessions.
                </p>
                <p>Today, we went over routes vs. paths, rendering vs. redirecting, cookies, and sessions. Routes are simply
                    the route a devloper wants to send or get data through, while the path contins a specific destination.
                    Stackoverflow defines rendering and redirect like the following: "res.render() will render the view with
                    data passed to it, res.redirect() will redirect a user to another page (at which point the request starts
                    over)". Where 'res' would be the response from the server. Cookies save the user's session data, are
                    statefull (have data), and reside on the client (a user's computers'). A session is the period of time
                    when the user is on an application and reside on the server. Devlopers will typically set a maximum length
                    of time a session can be live (i.e. 15 minutes).
                </p>
                <p>Our project for the day was to create an express server application that would allow a user to signup, login,
                    and then view their custom login page based on server-side authorization. The project also used server
                    side rendering to serve the HTML (mustache) files. After setting up the boiler plate for my express server
                    and installing the modules I would need, I began to set routes for the root page, signup page, login
                    page, and profile page. Corresponding mustache files were made for each. At a high level, the public
                    folder containing all the mustache and css files is set statically, a user then goes to the home page,
                    "/", clicks either signup or login, is then routed to eaither, "/signup" or "/login", fills out a form,
                    the form sends data back to the server through either the "/users" or "/login" route, and then are taken
                    to their personal profile page "/profile", where they prompted with a custom greeting message.</p>
                <p>This project was difficult, but I learned a shit ton from it. I'm still struggling a bit with the authorization
                    functions we went over in class, but feel a hell of alot better about it than I did two days ago. Backend
                    is pretty rad, but I am for sure leaning more towards focusing on front-end. I like that the front-end
                    has less 'convention'. It just has so much more room for creativity. </p>

                <h3>Model, View, Controller</h3>
                <p class="content">The past couple of days, we have been going over server side rendering more in depth and reviewing a type
                    of heiarchy called Model, View, Controller (MVC). In an MVC heiarchy the model is the data, the controller
                    are the routes, and the view is the html. The CSS and front end JS both sit in a 'public folder that
                    is set staticlly via express.
                </p>
                <p>Our weekend project for last week was to build a word guessing game, like hangman, but the entire application
                    must be served from the backend (i.e. server side). I struggled a good deal of trouble with setting up
                    the rendering, responses, routes, and middleware correctly, but eventually got it down. I was having
                    difficulty passing in the correct data to the rendered pages so the templating engine could have access
                    to them. It finally clicked with me that the data you pass to a rendered page is done so through the
                    form of an object. The object key's are equavilent to variable names to mustache. After I fugured this
                    out, I was moving. The next part I struggled with initally was when to use .redirect or .render. I then
                    figured out that a devloper will typically 'redirect' when dealing with a post and render when dealing
                    with a get. Although this is not an absolute rule, it seems to follow suit most of the time.
                </p>
                <p>It took me hours to conceptually understand that node is simply Javascript and I can write functions on the
                    server just like I would on the front end. Once this clicked with me, I was moving even faster in my
                    developement process. Our assignment for this afternoon, was to take what we had learned from today regarding
                    the MVC heairchy and refactor our word guessing application to fit in that structure. Prior to this refactor,
                    we had all of our routes, variables, data, logic, and middleware in one file. When a file has so much
                    going on, it makes it difficult to debug and even more difficult to read. There is no syntatic sugar
                    with a file containg such a range of information.</p>
                <p>This word guessing game is by far, the most proud I am of a project, as it was the most challengin for me.
                    Although I am not quite done with refactor yet, I do have a good idea of how to accomplish and what to
                    'require' to format the application into a MVC format.</p>

                <h3>ORM's, SQL, and Databses</h3>
                <p class="content">The later part of this week revolved around learning a Javascript ORM, Sequelizer, SQL, and PostgrSQL. We
                    first dove into SQL and learned the basic SQL commands, SELECT, INSERT, DELETE, FROM, WHERE, and JOIN.
                    SELECT queries are used when retrieving data from a database. INSERT statements are used for inserting
                    data into a database. DELETE statements are used to delete data from a database. The FROM paramater specifies
                    which table you are adding to or manipulating data from. WHERE acts as a filter for your query. JOIN
                    allows developers to access tables from other tables by using primary keys and foreign keys. Although
                    there are many databses, we spent our time working with PostgreSQL which was can accessed via CLI with
                    the 'psql' command.
                </p>
                <p>After getting the basics of SQL down, we went into learning an ORM. ORM stands for Object-Relational Mapping.
                    An ORM essentially allows to manipulate database in the language of your choice WITHOUT actually writing
                    SQL. Javascript has an ORM called 'Sequelizer', which we spent two days learning. At a high level, Sequelizer
                    makes sense, but getting into the syntax of it was rather confusing to me. It's pretty damn cool that
                    I am able to manipulate a database with Javascript. If my server is running on Node.js, and I am using
                    sequelizer, then my server configuration and database queries are both using Javascipt. This makes my
                    backend code both efficient and fluid. Setting up Sequlizer, like most ORM's, is a bit of a pain, but
                    once it's initialized and configured, data manipulation isn't too difficult. Although, the documentation
                    is a MUST for any ORM. The hardest part of using sequelizer is remembering the syntax and methods that
                    come with using it.
                </p>
                <p>Our project on Wednesday was to take our todo list app we built on an express server, and save the todos
                    to a database that can then be accesses even if the server is restarted. Our weekend project that was
                    assigned this afternoon, was to take our music player app and save the user's search results to a database
                    using Sequelizer. This will allow a user to reference any past search results they have made when visiting
                    the music player app.</p>
                <p>It's pretty fucking cool to be building full stack applications, but introducing a database into an already
                    existing application is rather difficult. I was busy this afternoon getting my refactor of my todo to
                    be fully functional and aesthetically appealing. I was also working on refactoring my word guess app
                    to have seperate controllers for each route, so I have not yet gotten to 'Sequelizing' my music player
                    app. My goal is to have my music player app saving queries to a Postgres database by the end of the day....But
                    we will see how that goes. </p>

                <h3>MongoDB, Primary Keys, & Foreign Keys</h3>
                <p class="content">This week we have been going over different types of databases other than relational databases or SQL databases.
                    Relational databases work off of a schema and have tables. They are structured and as such work with
                    a structured query language like SQL. Databases that are not structured are referred to as no-sql databases.
                    We have been learning MongoDB this week which is an example of a no-sql database. Instead of tables,
                    the data is stored in what is like one massive document. Data does not have to have specific columns.
                    The data going into a no-sql database can be unique to itself.
                </p>
                <p>Today we refactored a project that was simply pulling in data from JSON file to be pulling data in from MongoDB.
                    I imported the JSON file to database that was created via Mongo, and used vanilla mongo syntax to pull
                    data from the DB into a rendered page of my choosing. I was doing server-side rendering using mustache
                    and the data from the mongodb.
                </p>
                <p>So far, I seem to be drawn to Mongo more than Postrgres. I like that the data in Mongo does not have to be
                    structurerd. If you want to retrieve any data from a no-sql database, you can query it, just like you
                    can a relational database. To me, no-sql databases seem to make the most sense unless you are woeking
                    with an enterprise who has a great deal of red tape and a strong technological architecture.</p>
                <p>Our project for the wee was given to us on Monday, three days earlier than normal. The reason our project
                    was assigned to us so early is due to that fact that IT IS ALOT. We are essentially building a server-side
                    renndered Twiter clone. It must consist of a signup, login, message board, have the ability to like and
                    delete posts. And also save sessions, and go through authorization. I am so stoked on this project and
                    so far have given my application the ability to create users, save them to a Postgres DB, be verified
                    at the login, and take the user to a custom profile page where they can submit a message (or a tweet).
                    Although my application does not good aesthetically, the logic is getting there. My focus is getting
                    all the logic an algorithms in place, then I will worry about the styling. </p>

                <h3>Reflecting, Building a Social Media App, & Choosing a Specialization</h3>
                <p class="content">Lately, I have been immersed in modern backend technologies inlcuding node, npm, node modules, relational
                    databases, and non relational databases. This knowledge of the backend alognside the front end knowledge
                    we gained in the first month has given me all the tools I need to make any kind of web app there is.
                    As I mentioned earlier, the project we were assigned last week a social media application that used entirely
                    server-side rendering.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The project encapsulateted everything we have learned to date. Front end styling, back end endpoinst (routes), querying the
                    database, using templating engines, saving user's data to a database, and authenticating users. The Iron
                    Yard has been a hell of a ride so far. It has been the most challenging and rewarding thing I have ever
                    been a part of.
                </p>
                <p>The social media app I built is definately one of the most rewarding things I have ver accomplished. It's
                    not Facebook or Twitter, but I am insanely proud of it. It shows me how far I have come and that with
                    the right tools, anything is possible.</p>
                <p>We are coming up on the end of month two, which means that I will be choosing a 'specialization' for month
                    three. Our options of specialization are either React, Java, or Ruby on Rails. Although, backend technologies
                    intrigue me, I am definately leaning towards React at the moment. I love the creativity that with working
                    with the frontend. I also see a huge shift of the front end doing the majority of the workload. The backend
                    is gradually becoming more and more automated. Do not get me wrong, Backend engineers are still in dire
                    need, but I just like the idea of working with the components that are the driving force. I also feel
                    that I have a pretty solid understanding of node.js, which is growing rapidly in popularity. I love working
                    Javascript. I love that it is an interpreted language and uses hoisting. I have come to love the things
                    that some hate about working with Javascript. Who knows though, I could come out of The Iron Yard working
                    with PHP, Ruby, Java, or .NET. I would be amped to learn any of these technologies, but for now, I want
                    to continue my efforts to get a solid handle of the polorizing language that is ES6.</p>

                <h3>More Mongo, API's, Token Authentication, & Higher Level Concepts </h3>
                <p class="content">The past week has been very rough. Last week, week 8, was the hardest week I have had at The Iron Yard. It
                    was filled with many daily projects that were the size of some of our weekly projects in the past. Ths
                    caused me to become overwhelmed about halfway through week 8. One project that I was excited about was
                    building a vending machine API. This vending machine API was built using node.js and express. We used
                    a piece of software called Postman to post data to routes and get information from routes. This vending
                    machine application simulates all the elements of a RESTful API. You can GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE data
                    from the vendng machine.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I was using Mongo for my database on the vending machine project and used it once more last week when creating a stat tracker
                    application. This stat tracker application allowed users to create an activity, like climbing stairs,
                    insert a number of stairs climbed on a particular day, and log that data into a database. The application
                    allowed users to update stats daily, delete a stat, update an activity, or delete an activity. For this
                    application, I used token authentication. I uased a node module on the backend called 'jsonWebToken'
                    which allowed me to generate a token for a user. I allowed the users to signup and login. Once the users'
                    username and password is verified, they are given a token. Once the user recieves a token, they may see
                    the data in the stat tracker application.
                </p>
                <p>Another concept we went over last week was TDD (test driven developement). The idea of TDD is simple, write
                    test before you write code for your application. However, the actual implementation for TDD is not that
                    simple. In Javascript, there are several modules I have been using for writing tests. They are 'Mocha',
                    'Chai', and 'Supertest'. Mocha and Chai are used for feature testing while supertest is used for testing
                    routes. I do understand that TDD is how programming should be done, but it does add a substantial amount
                    of time to coding applications. I do think that learning curve is rater steep, but do believe that it
                    will get much easier and faster once I learn the sntax and testing habbits of the modules I am using
                    to test. </p>
                <p>This week I started my specialization with React.js. However, Tanner has spent the first two days going over
                    higher level concepts beore diving into react. We went over prototypes in Javascript, how Javascript
                    does not have true inheritience, prototypal inheritence in Javascript, and the new 'class' keyword in
                    ECMAscript 6. Although classes do not exist in Javascript, this 'syntactic sugar' of the 'class' keyowrd
                    in ES6 makes it much more like other OOP languages. There is a shift within Javascript where ths syntax
                    is beginning to look more and more like other languages. I honestly really enjoy talking about higher
                    level OOP concepts and looking at the more computer science-y things in relation to programming.</p>
                <p>All in all, I am super pumped with my progression and excited to finally dive into react tomorrow.
                </p>
                <p>Cheers! :)</p>

                <h3>So That's React</h3>
                <p class="content">I have been curious about using for the better part of 7 months now. I was going to introduce myself to React
                    sooner, but I really wanted to have a solid foundation of Javascript before getting into an exensive
                    Javascript library. It was important to me to have a true understanding of how Javascript works and understand
                    all the quirks that belong to Javascript. Let me say, I definately glad I did.
                </p>
                <p>
                    So react uses components to structure applications. Every part of the webpage is a component. The header, the navbar, the
                    sidebar, the footer, everything is a component. This is the best part about react. React uses a thing
                    called a 'key' to keep track of every component and every child in a component. React only renders the
                    part of the site that has changed. This makes react effective, compartmentalized, and fast. React is
                    ideal for websites that are passing alot of data through it. Since react is only updating the components
                    that change, the nodes that are getting new data are the only thing being repainted on the page. React
                    does this by using what is called the 'virtual DOM'. React is constantly comparing the virtual DOM to
                    the actual DOM and if react detects a difference between the two, the repaints the node that changed.
                </p>
                <p>The weird par about react is that it uses JSX. JSX is basically Javascript + XML/HTML. In react, you write
                    html in javascript files. Since you are in a javascript file, you can write Javascript. This makes for
                    a very interesting syntax. React uses state and props to pass data around. State is data that belongs
                    to a particular component, a smart component. Props is data that is passed to a 'dumb component' from
                    it's parent component. It is ideal to have many dumb components and few smart components. </p>
                <p>I have built a couple of applications using react, and can say I really do like it. Working with react is
                    like working with custom legos. You build lego pieces (components) that you then put together to make
                    a giant lego structure. I am still new to react, but I am really trying to dive into it and understand
                    as much as possible.</p>

                <h3>Components, State, & Props</h3>
                <p class="content">The past week I have been working in React every day for hours on end. I am beginning to feel familiar with
                    how React Works, and that damn JSX doesn't seem as scary as it did a week ago. In fact, I would argue
                    that I MIGHT actually prefer JSX over HTML. I thouroughly do enjoy writing Javascript in the middle of
                    HTML. To me, JSX tends to be easier to read than hopping back and forth between your HTML and external
                    Javascript file.
                </p>
                <p> The most confusing part about working with React was the idea of state and the difference between state and
                    props. I understood what state and props were at a high level, but it took me about 30 hours of working
                    in react to get a good idea of how they differ and when to use each. As I mentioned in an previous post,
                    there are two type of components in react, dumb components and smart components. Something that clicked
                    with me recently was the that you should have AS FEW SMART COMPONENTS AS POSSIBLE in your application.
                    A smart component is component that is managing state (data). I learned (the hard way) that when you
                    have multiple components managing state, shit.gets.confusing. In React, it is vital to think about the
                    architecture of your site throuroughly. You need to think about where your state will live and how you
                    will be passing that state down to child components via props.
                </p>
                <p>Props is simply data passed to a child component from a parent component. After working 40+ hours with react
                    this past week, I began to feel more and more comfortable using props, naming the props was passing down,
                    and in which component I should be writing functions. In react, you can pass functions from one component
                    to another in the same manner that you would when passing any other data, via props. </p>
                <p>That last thing that I will say about my 'React Immersion' this past week, is the use of inline styling when
                    dealing with react components. Although you can use external stylesheets when working in react, it is
                    best practices to keep your styling within the component itself. This makes sense because when you want
                    to re-use a component, you have it's corresponding styles right there in the render.</p>
                <p>The latest react project I have been working is a fictitous e-commerce store that sells sneakers. You can
                    take a looka at that bad boy <a href="https://github.com/keeganthomp/reactEcommerceStore">here </a>.

                <h3>React & Redux</h3>
                <p class="content">This past week, I have spent working with and learning Redux. Redux is a state management module that allows
                    developers to keep track of state in one place instead of having state spread across different components.
                    Redux does this through a 'store'. A store in redux is simply a place where state lives. If you want
                    data from the store, you dispatch it to the component you want to use it in. Actually, you technically
                    'map' state and 'dispatch' actions.
                </p>
                <p> Actions in redux are like messages. These actions then get sent to what is called a reducer. The reducer
                    is essentially a function that manipulates data sent over through an action. An action has a payload
                    that is sent to the reducer along with the action itself. A payload is data that is sent through an action
                    to the reducer. Actions are typically used via clicks on buttons. The payload is typically data from
                    an input or form. There are also containers, which hold the components. As mentioned earlier, state is
                    mapped to compnents from the store and actions are dispatched to components. Both of which are done through
                    functions at the bottom of the container or the component itself.
                </p>
                <p>I actually enjoy working with redux and how easy it makes passing state from component to component. The
                    problem with redux is getting the architecture right and remembering to always to clone state through
                    each of the cases in the reducers. Bottom-line, Redux rules, but it truly only makes sense when you are
                    working on a large application with mass amounts of data. I keep hearing about Mobx, which is a simpler
                    approach to state management and WAYYY less cumbersome to set up. I'm stoked to have a use case for Mobx
                    in the near future.</p>
